Slovak MorphoDiTa Models
========================

To use this model, you need MorphoDiTa: Morphological Dictionary and Tagger, an
open-source tool for morphological analysis of natural language texts. Please
visit the MorphoDiTa website http://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/morphodita for more
information.


Slovak MorphoDiTa Models
========================

Slovak models are distributed under the CC BY-NC-SA
(http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/) licence. The Slovak
morphology uses the MorfFlex SK 170914 (http://hdl.handle.net/11234/1-3277)
Slovak morphological dictionary and the Slovak tagger is trained on
automatically translated PDT 3.0 (http://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/pdt3.0). Slovak models
work in MorphoDiTa version 1.9 or later.

Apart from MorfFlex SK dictionary, a statistical guesser is implemented and can
be optionally used when performing morphological analysis.

Slovak models are versioned according to the version of the MorfFlex SK
morphological dictionary used, the version format is YYMMDD, where YY, MM and DD
are two-digit representation of year, month and day, respectively. The latest
version is 170914.

LINDAT/CLARIN project of the Ministry of Education of the Czech Republic
(project LM2015071).

The Czech morphological system was devised by Jan Hajič.

The MorfFlex SK dictionary was created by Jan Hajič and Jan Hric.

The tagger algorithm and feature set research was supported by the projects
MSM0021620838 and LC536 of Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of the Czech
Republic, GA405/09/0278 of the Grant Agency of the Czech Republic and

performed by Drahomíra "johanka" Spoustová, Jan Hajič, Jan Raab and Miroslav
Spousta.

The tagger is trained on morphological layer of Prague Dependency Treebank PDT
3.0, which was supported by the projects LM2010013, LC536, LN00A063 and

Slovak Morphological System
---------------------------

In the Slovak language, MorphoDiTa uses the same morphological system as Czech.


Main Slovak Model
-----------------

The main Slovak model contains the following files:

slovak-morfflex-170914.dict
  Morphological dictionary based on the Jan Hajič's (Hajič 2004
  (http://books.google.cz/books?id=sB63AAAACAAJ)) system with PDT tag set
  created from MorfFlex SK 170914 (http://hdl.handle.net/11234/1-3277)
  morphological dictionary.

slovak-morfflex-pdt-170914.tagger
  Tagger trained on the training portion of automatically translated PDT 3.0
  (http://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/pdt3.0) using the neopren feature set. It contains
  the slovak-morfflex-170914.dict morphological dictionary. and reaches 92.8%
  tag accuracy, 96.3% lemma accuracy and 92.0% overall accuracy on PDT 3.0
  (http://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/pdt3.0) etest data (whose morphological tags and
  lemmas were remapped using the slovak-morfflex-170914.dict dictionary). Model
  speed: ~5k words/s, model size: 17MB.


Part of Speech Only Variant
---------------------------

The PDT tag set used by the main Slovak model is very fine-grained. In many
situations, only the part of speech tags would be sufficient. Therefore, we
provide a variant of the model, denoted as pos_only, where only the first two
characters of the fifteen-letter tags are used, representing the part of speech
and detailed part of speech, respectively. There are 67 such two-letter tags.

slovak-morfflex-170914-pos_only.dict
  A variant of `slovak-morfflex-170914.dict`, where only the first two tag
  characters are used.

slovak-morfflex-pdt-170914-pos_only.tagger
  Very fast variant of slovak-morfflex-170914.tagger predicting only
  two-character tags. It reaches 98.3% tag accuracy, 97.4% lemma accuracy and
  96.8% overall accuracy on PDT 3.0 (http://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/pdt3.0) etest data
  (which morphological tags and lemmas were remapped using the
  slovak-morfflex-170914-pos_only.dict dictionary). Model speed: ~200k words/s,
  model size: 4MB.


No Diacritical Marks Variant
----------------------------

Sometimes the text to be analyzed does not contain diacritical marks. We
therefore provide variants of the morphological dictionary and tagger for this
purpose - morphological analysis, morphological generation and tagging employ
forms without diacritical marks. Note that the lemmas do have diacritical marks.

We provide the no_dia variants for all four models described above:

slovak-morfflex-170914-no_dia.dict
  No diacritical marks variant of slovak-morfflex-170914.dict.

slovak-morfflex-pdt-170914-no_dia.tagger
  No diacritical marks variant of slovak-morfflex-170914.tagger. It reaches
  91.4% tag accuracy, 92.8% lemma accuracy and 89.0% overall accuracy on PDT 3.0
  (http://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/pdt3.0) etest data (which morphological tags and
  lemmas were remapped using the slovak-morfflex-170914-no_dia.dict dictionary)
  with diacritical marks removed. Model speed: ~5k words/s, model size: 18MB.

slovak-morfflex-170914-no_dia-pos_only.dict
  No diacritical marks variant of slovak-morfflex-170914-pos_only.dict.

slovak-morfflex-pdt-170914-no_dia-pos_only.tagger
  No diacritical marks variant of slovak-morfflex-170914-pos_only.tagger. It
  reaches 97.5% tag accuracy, 93.9% lemma accuracy and 93.2% overall accuracy on
  PDT 3.0 (http://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/pdt3.0) etest data (which morphological tags
  and lemmas were remapped using the slovak-morfflex-170914-no_dia-pos_only.dict
  dictionary) with diacritical marks removed. Model speed: ~200k words/s, model
  size: 7MB.
